Question 11 - Personal Web Page Generator

Write a program that asks the user for his or her name, then asks the user to enter a sentence that describes himself or herself. Here is an example of the programâ€™s screen:

Enter your name: Julie Taylor [ENTER]
Describe yourself: I am a computer science major, a member of the Jazz club, and I hope to work as a mobile app developer after I graduate. [ENTER]

Once the user has entered the requested input, the program should create an HTML file, containing the input, for a simple Web page. Here is an example of the HTML content, using the sample input previously shown:

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
   <center>
      <h1>Julie Taylor</h1>
   </center>
   <hr />
   I am a computer science major, a member of the Jazz club,
   and I hope to work as a mobile app developer after I graduate.
   <hr />
</body>
