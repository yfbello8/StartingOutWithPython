Question 4 - Item Counter

Assume a file containing a series of names (as strings) is named names.txt and exists on the computer's disk. Write a program that displays the number of names that are stored in the file. (Hint: Open the file and read every string stored in it. Use a variable to keep a count of the number of items that are read from the file.)
